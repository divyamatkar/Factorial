     Experiment: Create a Node.js Application to Serve a Static Website
   </p>
   <p> Aim: To create a Node.js application using Express.js that serves a static website stored in a public folder.</p>
   <p>Ojective</p>
    
   <li>
    <ul>To install and use Node.js and Express framework.</ul>
    <ul> To understand how to serve static files (HTML, CSS, images, JS) using Express.</ul>
    <ul> To configure routing in Express.</ul>
    <ul> To run a local server and access the webpage via a browser.</ul>
   </li>

   <p>Theory
          Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling developers to run JavaScript outside the browser—mainly on servers.
          Express.js is a lightweight and flexible Node.js web application framework used for building server applications efficiently. It provides methods for routing, handling requests, responses, and serving static files.
          Static websites contain fixed content (HTML, CSS, images). To serve them using Node.js, Express provides a built-in middleware called express.static() which makes it easy to host files without manually writing routing logic for each file.</p>
    <p>Conclusion
In this experiment, a simple Node.js application was successfully developed using Express.js to serve a static HTML webpage. The express.static() middleware made it easy to host static files, while routing and server setup helped understand basic server-side functionality. This demonstrates how Express can be used to create efficient and scalable web server applications.</p>
